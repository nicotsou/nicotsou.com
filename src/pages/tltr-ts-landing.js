              developers prefer to learn TypeScript over JavaScript

          <p>JavaScript never had types.</p>
          <p>
            We used to be the rebels. Now types are in every project. Switching
            your mindset takes time. Adding types to a language that hasn't made
            for them is also a trivial challenge. Thankfully, TypeScript
            developers have found a practical way.

          <p>
            Ah, and <strong>adding types is only the beginning.</strong> Every
            new tool you introduce in your codebase comes with its own
            surprises. What‚Äôs the best way of structuring your codebase with
