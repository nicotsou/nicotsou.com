            I specialize in front-end development. It bridges my two passions;
            technology and design. Creating the user experiences of your dreams
            is an immensely satisfying process. The learning journey, although
            challenging at first, can be incredibly enjoyable. I strongly
            believe that following your passion can{' '}

            My job gave me the opportunity to try different projects and roles.
            From building solutions for large-scale client applications in the
            finance/ travel/ communications sectors to leading teams by enabling
            creative collaboration and establishing agile principles.

            I had the chance to work with companies such as UBS, British
            Telecom, Qatar Airways, and RE/MAX. Formerly, I worked for small to
            medium companies specializing in marketing, advertising, and web
            development. I have the experience of working as a freelancer and
            also attempted to build a startup.
