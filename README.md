This repo hosts my personal blog.

Welcome to my world. A place where anti-patterns and dirty code create an unprecedented experience. A leap forward in boring engineering blogs, mixed with buzzwords and glossy images. This is how my narcissistic instincts come together in harmony.

## Operation Manual

### Installation 🎬 process

We use npm and _not_ yarn:

```shell
npm install
```

### Time to 🧑‍💻 write code

The `start` script hosts the site in the local network. It's much more easier to debug on devices:

```shell
npm start
```

Tip: You can set a local hostname to avoid using IPs.

### Time to 🧪 test

No test library yet. Will

### Time to ✨ upgrade

Run the interactive script.

```shell
npx run upgrade-interactive
```

Then select the packages you would like to upgrade and test if everything works.

3.  **Open the code and start customizing!**

    Your site is now running at http://localhost:8000!

    Edit `src/pages/index.js` to see your site update in real-time!
