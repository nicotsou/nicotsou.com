In collaboration with Iurii Bura.

This talk covers key strategies for creating and maintaining reusable UI component libraries in an enterprise environment. It highlights important attributes such as increased development speed, improved consistency, accessibility, and reduced maintenance costs.

We share our examples from real-world applications and case studies that illustrate successful component library implementations in large enterprises, offering insights into best practices—from establishing a design system to incorporating version control and thorough documentation.

Attendees gain a comprehensive understanding of the benefits and processes involved, along with practical tools and knowledge to implement a component library within their own organizations.
