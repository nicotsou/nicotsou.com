TypeScript has changed the software industry, and it has become the de-facto way of delivering JS applications.

Allow me to introduce you once again to TS. This time, we will focus on the most common misconceptions about the language. We will talk about its powerful features, that set it apart from any other programming language out there.

I will share with you my mental model about types, to help you navigate the type universe and make the right decisions about your code.

## Key Topics Covered

- [TLTR; TypeScript](/tltr-typescript) is an introduction to the language fundamentals.
- [Types Of TypeScript](tltr-typescript-types) presents the basic types.
- [Master TypeScript Functions](/tltr-typescript-functions) is a guide to understand everything about functions.
- [Master TypeScript Classes](/tltr-typescript-classes) is a guide to understand classes.
- [Master TypeScript Interfaces](/tltr-typescript-interfaces) is a guide to understand interfaces.
