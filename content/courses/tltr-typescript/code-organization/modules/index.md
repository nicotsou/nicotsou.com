A deep dive into Modules in TypeScript/JavaScript. Watch this video to learn everything you need to know about how to break apart your apps into modules, to enable code reuse and better organization. We will start from simple import/export statements, to installing packages, all the way up to more advanced concepts such as dynamic imports, immutability, and path resolution. And since this is a TypeScript course, we will also talk about exporting our types!

👩‍💻🧑🏿‍💻 Practice what you've learned in the next module.
