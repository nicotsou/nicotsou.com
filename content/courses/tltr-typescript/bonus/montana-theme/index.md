Have you ever wondered which theme I'm using in my videos?

The truth is, I didn’t want to use an existing theme. I wanted the theme to match with the look and feel of the course. To have a visual harmony. To blend nicely with the other design elements I'm using here. That’s why I designed it by myself. And now it's publicaly available.

The official TLTR; TypeScript theme for Visual Studio Code is now available for download.

> It's called Montana

### Download instructions

Go to [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NicotsouThemes.montana) and click install.

Alternatively, you can launch Visual Studio Code and search "Montana" in the Theme Extensions.
