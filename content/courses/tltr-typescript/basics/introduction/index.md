Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my [TLTR; TypeScript](http://tltr-typescript.com) course! Here you can find all the material I have published in my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/nicotsou) and in [personal blog](http://nicotsou.com).

This course is currently under development. I'm adding content on a regular basis. Most of the material are available for free, but here they are presented in a better way. Together with the content of this course, I'm building a custom courseware platform.

I wish you all the best for your learning journey!
