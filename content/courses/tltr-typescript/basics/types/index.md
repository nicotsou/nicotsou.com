Master Types in TypeScript. I start with basic JavaScript concepts to understand the mechanics of the language. Learn the built-in types of TypeScript and how to use them. Discover how to bypass type checking with the keyword any and ts-ignore. Discover the wildcard keyword unknown and learn how it helps you guard unpredictable variables. Create your own unions, enums and type aliases.
