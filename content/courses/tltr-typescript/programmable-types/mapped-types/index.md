How well do you know unions in TypeScript? Join me in this episode to discover everything you need to know about unions in TypeScript. We will talk about what a union really is, the syntax, and under which circumstances it could be useful. I will show you how to use literal types to create more advanced definitions for your types. We will learn the concept of discriminated unions, and I will show some practical examples to get the most out of them.
