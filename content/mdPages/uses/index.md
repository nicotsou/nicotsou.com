I have a confession to make.

When I was a kid, I had a lot of trouble when I was going for holidays. I was one of these geeks that likes to take all his devices everywhere. Even when when I was visiting my grandparents for a couple of weeks, I was not even considering leaving home without taking my PC (yes the one with the CRT screen), my endless bags with accessories, CDs and games.

Yes, the situation is different now that I grew up. Well, no! I’m a terrible liar.

Technology was always a big part of my life. As a gadget aficionado, I spend a lot of time and money on devices. You know that feeling of wanting something so badly that you tell excuses to yourself for how much you want it?

“I’m a Pro, I need that thing”

That’s why you’ll see a lot of gear in the next sections. I can’t stress enough that you _don't_ need any of these to get started. We are obsessed about what other people are using and we are thinking their success comes from their hardware. Well, [sometimes it does](https://www.youtube.com/@theslowmoguys), but most of the times decent content, authenticity, and good story telling is all that matters.

And after that long disclaimer, here’s my setup.

## The Hardware

### Coffee Machine

Let's start with the most important one. You know what they say about developers and coffee. Well, I'm not an exception to this rule. I love drinking coffee and especially _espresso_.

My current espresso machine is quite big. I got inspired by James Hoffman and his magnificent book about coffee. And since I'm leaving in Zurich, I couldn't say no to swiss engineering.
